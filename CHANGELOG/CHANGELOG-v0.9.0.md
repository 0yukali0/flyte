### Flytekit
* Fast register - code only changes no longer need a rebuild of the container to run
* Workflow archive/activate command in flyte-cli
* Bug fixes and misc improvements

Also, please take a look at the newest [alpha release](https://github.com/lyft/flytekit/releases/tag/v0.16.0a0) of Flytekit (v0.16.0a0) which introduces native Python based typing, and a new way of workflow authoring that enables local workflow execution.
