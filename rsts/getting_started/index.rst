Getting Started
===============

In this guide we'll walk through just how quick and easy it is to begin using flytekit, deploy a sandbox version of Flyte
and run it on your local machine, and then finally deploy Flyte to a cloud provider to run it as a hosted service

TODO: Fill out the remainder of this list!

* Getting started with the flytekit sdk (<5 seconds):

.. code-block:: text

   pip install flytekit==0.16.0b6


* One line to get a local cluster running (< 1 minute).

    * TODO: move local set-up prequisites here from install/getting_started.rst
    * One or 0 lines to have existing examples registered in flyte
    * One line to make a change and deploy (< 30 secs)


.. code-block:: text

   make deploy_sandbox


* One line to get a remote cluster running (< 2 minutes)

    * The cluster is provisioned

* One line to get remote cluster running in one namespace (<2 minutes)
* Simplified customization to improve removing minio and replace minio with Cloud storage - One change, build and deploy (3 lines total) (< 3 minutes)
* Deploy one k8s cloud cluster

Coming soon:

* Deploying Flyte to a multi-cluster environment
