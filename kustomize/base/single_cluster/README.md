# Flyte Single cluster deployment mode
This allows flyte to be deployed in one Kubernetes cluster.
All components are deployed and can be configured to use dependencies based on the environment.

To understand configuration of dependencies refer to sandbox or any cloud deployments

Overlays using the single cluster mode
1. [Sandbox Overlay](../../overlays/sandbox)
1. [GCP SingleCluster Overlay](../../overlays/gcp)
1. [EKS SingleCluster Overlay](../../overlays/eks)

These overlays are based on [Flyte Single Cluster deployment Configuration base](./complete)
